Some do's in Italy
- Be conscious of how you dress. Italians base and judge each other based off of what they dress in and what they look
like. You want to be able to present yourself.
- As like any big city, you have to be very careful about your belongings. Make sure in any busy areas or big cities
that you keep your belongings close and closed.
- Cover your knees and shoulders when out. Italy is still a very Catholic country, and follows the rules of dressing
modestly when it comes to going to church so you won’t be able to enter unless you’re covered up.
- Unlike most countries Not all shops and restaurants in Italy take credit cards, and it’s better to be safe when it
comes to that kind of thing.

Some dont's in Italy
- Dont say Ciao when first meeting someone. Ciao is reserved for greeting acquaintances & friends; instead, say
Buon Giorno (good morning) or Buona Sera (good afternoon/evening).
- Don't wear flip flops while walking around Italy. You don’t need to be the typical Australian tourist wearing white
sneakers all the time, but wearing comfortable shoes while exploring the different cities will make a huge difference
- Don't over tip, Tipping in restaurants is not mandatory in Italy, as the service is already included in the bill.
Over tipping can be seen as pity money.
- Avoid making generalised comments about Italian crime, corruption, the Mafia or Italy’s involvement in World War II.
This leads to unpleasant conversations and can make people feel uncomfortable with the stereotypes
